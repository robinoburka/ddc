# `ddc` - Dev Dir Cleaner

A tiny tool to keep a developer's disk tidy.

Regular development across multiple projects often results in directories scattered all over the disk. This tool helps identify these directories and clean them up when needed.

## Installation

This project is in the preview stage and is not yet published through standard channels. You can install it from source.

Since this project requires iterating over BTree nodes, it needs the `nightly` version of Rust. Make sure to install the appropriate toolchain:

```shell
rustup toolchain install nightly
```

Use the standard compilation command to build the project:

```shell
cargo +nightly build --release
```

Then, copy the resulting binary to a preferred location covered by `$PATH`.

Alternatively, use the `cargo install` command:

```shell
cargo +nightly install --path .
```

## Usage

The basic usage requires simply running the command:

```shell
ddc
```

By default, this executes the `analyze` subcommand:

```shell
ddc analyze
```

A configuration file is required. To generate an example configuration file, run:

```shell
ddc generate-config
```

Then, follow the instructions in the file to set it up.

### How to Read the Output
The output includes two key columns to help you evaluate the projects on your disk:
- **Last Change**: Shows the most recent modification within the entire directory tree. This helps you identify stale projects.
- **Size**: Displays the total size of the directory and all its subdirectories. This helps you identify large projects that may be consuming unnecessary space.

Both columns use color coding - green, yellow, and red - to convey the following meanings:
- **Last Change**
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: The project was updated very recently.
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: The project was updated in the recent past.
  - ðŸ”´ Red: The project hasnâ€™t been updated in a long time.
- **Size**
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: The project takes up little space.
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: The project occupies a moderate amount of space.
  - ðŸ”´ Red: The project takes up a large amount of space.

This color coding makes it easy to quickly assess your projects and decide which ones to keep or clean up. For example:
- ðŸŸ¢ Green â€“ ðŸ”´ Red: The project is actively developed and takes up a lot of space. You likely want to keep it.
- ðŸ”´ Red â€“ ðŸŸ¢ Green: The project is stale but doesnâ€™t use much space. Itâ€™s probably fine to keep.
- ðŸ”´ Red â€“ ðŸ”´ Red: The project is both stale and large. Consider cleaning it up.
- Other combinations should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

## Configuration

`ddc` identifies well-known paths used by popular tools. However, it cannot automatically determine where you store your projects. Thatâ€™s why a configuration file is necessary.

### Minimal Configuration

As a minimum, you need to specify the path to your main development directory. For example:

```toml
[[paths]]
path = "projects/"
discovery = true
```

### Record Structure

Each record follows this structure:

```toml
[[paths]]
name = "Custom virtualenv location"
path = ".virtualenvs/"
discovery = false
language = "python"
```

Where:

- `name` *(optional)* â€“ A name for the path. Displayed in the toolâ€™s output if `discovery` is set to `false`.
- `path` â€“ The directory path. All paths are assumed to be relative to your home directory.
- `discovery` â€“ If `true`, auto-discovery is enabled. This means `ddc` will try to identify paths such as virtual environments or Rust build directories.
- `language` *(optional)* â€“ The associated programming language. This setting is only useful when `discovery` is set to `false` and improves visual representation.

### Default Discovery Definitions

To see the paths that `ddc` scans by default, run:

```shell
ddc analyze --show-definitions
```
